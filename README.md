# 🧮 Graph Algorithms Project — Huffman Coding & Tree Isomorphism

## 📖 Overview
This project presents two algorithmic implementations in graph theory:
1. **Huffman Coding (encode/decode)** — builds canonical Huffman codes with deterministic ordering and prefix-free validation.  
2. **Tree Isomorphism** — checks if two trees are isomorphic and constructs a node mapping when they are.

The project emphasizes **algorithmic correctness** and **complexity analysis**, demonstrating both theoretical and practical understanding of data structures and algorithm design.
